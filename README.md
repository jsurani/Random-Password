Made up a safe password, but completely randomly.
Used ASCII number values and loops to create a random string of 10 lowercase letters. 
Then, created a string with 10 random numbers between 0-9. 
Then, iterate through both strings, and alternate between adding the letters of the two strings into a new string which will be the password. 
Used the printToScreen() function to print the new password.
